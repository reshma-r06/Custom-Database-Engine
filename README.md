# Custom-Database-Engine

Designed and developed a lightweight in-memory database engine in C++ that supports SQL-like commands (CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO, SELECT) via a custom-built parser and execution engine. Engineered a modular system with object-oriented principles, in-memory table modeling using STL containers, schema validation, and CLI-based user interaction. Built using CMake to ensure cross-platform portability and clean compilation structure.

- Simulated core relational DBMS functionality without third-party libraries.
- Implemented query parsing and command routing logic to emulate SQL behavior.
- Built a scalable foundation to support future enhancements like persistence and indexing.
